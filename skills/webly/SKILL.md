# Webly

Webly hosts the websites and shared files and folders that agents publish. Without an account you can publish a site in
one command; it is live for 24 hours and can be claimed for 7 days. The same
machine can also share files (as many links as fit in 500 MiB, the site
included, each live for 24 hours) without giving up its site. Once the
person signs in (OAuth over MCP) the site is theirs: permanent, editable through
Webly's MCP tools, with drafts, a quality gate, rollback, custom domains, forms
and analytics.

`{api}/llms.txt` is the full contract, where `{api}` is the `api` that
`webly.mjs doctor` reports (`https://api.webly.ai` unless `WEBLY_API_URL` is
set). Read it before building a framework (React) site, forms or domains, or
before changing a site that already uses the CMS or a managed blog, and before
telling the person something is not supported. If this file and the live API disagree, trust the API.

The helper that does every deterministic step is `scripts/webly.mjs` in this
skill's folder (zero dependencies, Node 20+). Below, `webly` means
`node <this skill's folder>/scripts/webly.mjs`.

## Language

Reply in the person's language. Keep URLs, commands, tool names and error
reasons exactly as returned.

## Step 0: find out where we are (every time, first)

A new session, `/clear` or a restart wipes the conversation, so all state lives
on disk and at the API. Rebuild it before doing anything:

1. Run `webly doctor`. It is read-only and never creates a token. It reports:
   - `credential`: `present` if an anonymous token is saved on this machine.
   - `site`: that site's `status`, `urls`, `liveUntil`, `claimUntil` and
     `next` (what the API says is allowed right now).
   - `mcp`: whether the Webly MCP server is configured for Claude Code
     (`via: plugin | user | project`) and Codex.
   - `project`: the site(s) the project in the current folder is linked to
     (`.webly/project.json`, see **Linked folders**), or `error` if that file
     can't be read.
   - `pending`: a step an earlier session asked you to finish, e.g. `claim`.
   - `updatedFrom`: set on the first run after this skill was updated. Tell
     the person in one line which version they are now on.
   - `update`: set when a newer version of this skill is published. Run its
     `command` (it matches how this copy was installed), tell the person in one
     line, then carry on with the task using this copy. The new one loads next
     session.
2. Check your own tool list for Webly MCP tools: `list_websites`, `whoami`,
   `create_claim_code` under a `webly` server (in Claude Code they are named
   `mcp__webly__…` or, from the plugin, `mcp__plugin_webly_webly__…`). A server
   that is configured but not in your tool list is **not loaded**.
   Resolve deferred tools with tool search before deciding a tool is absent.
   Loaded tools do not necessarily mean OAuth: API-key connections can manage
   sites but do not expose `create_claim_code` (only a signed-in person can claim).
3. **The folder's link comes first.** If `project.sites` names a site, that is
   the site this project updates: work on it, and never create or claim
   another site for this folder unless the person asks for a new one. If it is
   this machine's anonymous site, `webly deploy` updates it. If not, it is in
   an account: update it over MCP (**Working over MCP**).
4. Pick the row and follow it:

| # | Token saved | Webly MCP tools loaded | Who this is | Do this |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | no | no | New to Webly, or tools not loaded | If `mcp` shows Webly configured, they have an account: don't publish anonymously; ask them to start a new session (or type `/reload-plugins`) so the tools load. Otherwise **Publish without an account** (below); don't set up MCP until they want to keep the site. |
| 2 | yes | no | Published before; MCP was never set up or didn't load | Read `site.next`. While it lists `update`, keep publishing with `webly deploy`. If it lists only `claim`, or the person wants to keep the site, run **Keep the site**. |
| 3 | no | yes | Signed in | Use **Working over MCP**. Anything they deployed anonymously was already claimed. |
| 4 | yes | yes | Connected with a site still unclaimed | Call `list_websites` first. If the folder is linked to another site, or the account already has a site for this project (same name or folder), **don't claim**: tell the person, and work on that site; claim the anonymous copy only if they ask. Otherwise claim it: **Keep the site**, step 5. Never read `credentialFile` yourself. Continue with **Working over MCP** after claiming. |

If the person asks to connect, sign in, or use their Webly account, they already
have one: whatever the row, go to **Keep the site**. With a token saved, run it all.
With no token there is nothing to claim: run step 1, then step 4 if the tools are
loaded; if they aren't, ask the person to type `/reload-plugins` (Claude Code) or
start a new session, since sign-in needs the MCP tools. Don't publish anonymously
for them.

If `pending` is `claim` and the claim tool is available, finish the claim now (row 4,
including its `list_websites` check), without asking again: the person already
asked for it before the restart. If
`pending` is `claim` and the claim tool is unavailable, go to **Keep the
site**, step 2.

## Publish without an account

1. Put the site in a folder, e.g. `./site`, with `index.html` at its root.
   Plain HTML, CSS and JS work best here. Limits: 25 files, 1 MiB each, 5 MiB
   total; hidden files and `node_modules` are skipped. For a bigger or React
   site, sign in first (**Keep the site**) and build it over MCP.
   Give every HTML page share-preview tags in `<head>` so links unfurl in
   Slack, iMessage and X: `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`,
   `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image` (an absolute URL to a
   1200×630 image in the site, e.g. `/og.png`; the URL is known after the
   first deploy, so set it then and deploy again), `twitter:card` =
   `summary_large_image`, plus a favicon (`<link rel="icon">`).
2. Run `webly deploy ./site` (a single `.html` file works too). It creates the
   site on the first run and **updates the same site, same URL** after that. It
   waits for the build and prints the site JSON. A project folder whose
   `package.json` has a `build` script (Vite, Astro, CRA…) is built first and
   its output folder (`dist`, `build`, `out`…) deployed, so `webly deploy .`
   works. The site is named after `package.json`'s `name` or the project
   folder; pass `--name "…"` to choose. If that would be a meaningless name
   like `dist`, the first deploy stops and asks for one: ask the person what
   the project is called, and say it's only the label on their dashboard and
   claim page, not the web address (that's assigned automatically). Anonymous deploys go live on their
   own (the JSON's `live` line says so): there is no separate publish step, so
   don't ask the person to publish.
3. To start over with a different site and a new URL during the first 24 hours:
   `webly replace ./site`. Only when the person asks for a new site; the old
   one goes offline.

Publishing when the person asked you to publish, host or deploy is the
approval: an anonymous site is public as soon as it is live.

## Linked folders

The first deploy from a project writes `.webly/project.json` at the project's
root (the nearest folder with `package.json` or `.git`, never inside `dist/`):

```json
{ "sites": { "default": { "websiteId": "ws_…", "name": "…", "url": "https://….webly.site/" } } }
```

It holds no secret (the token stays in `~/.webly`); tell the person to commit it
so every clone deploys to the same site. Redeploying a linked folder is an
update of that site, never a new one. `webly deploy` stops, without publishing,
and says why when:

- **The linked site isn't this machine's anonymous site** (it was claimed, or
  the link came from someone else). Update it with a deploy ticket: call
  `begin_deploy` with the site's id, then `webly deploy <folder> --ticket
  <ticket>` (**Working over MCP**). If `begin_deploy` is a 404 (a fork, another
  account, a deleted site), ask the person whether to make a new site; never
  make one on your own.
- **The folder isn't linked and this machine is connected to an account.**
  Call `list_websites`. If a site's name matches the project, ask "update
  *X*, or make a new site?" (default: update) and never pick between similar
  names yourself. Then `webly link <websiteId>`. For a new site,
  `create_website` and link that. `--anonymous` publishes a throwaway
  anonymous site anyway; only when the person asks for one. It never
  overwrites this machine's existing anonymous site. `webly replace
  <folder> --anonymous` discards that site for a new URL: before running it,
  name the existing site and its URL, say that replacing takes it offline, and
  get the person's explicit yes. Asking for another anonymous site is not that
  yes.
- **The site changed since this machine last deployed it** (someone edited it
  in the dashboard or from another clone): the deploy still goes through, and
  the result has `replaced` (from and to version). Tell the person their
  earlier version was replaced and can be rolled back.

A second site for the same project (staging, a client copy) is an extra entry:
`create_website`, then `webly link <websiteId> --as staging`; `--to staging`
picks it. Without an account a machine has one anonymous site, so extra
entries need sign-in. If the file is lost, re-link the same way: `list_websites`,
confirm with the person, `webly link`. A file the helper can't read is never
overwritten: fix it or delete it.

## Share files (no website)

When the person wants to send or share files (a video, PDFs, a dataset,
photos) rather than publish a site:

1. If there is more than one file, ask whether they want **one link per file**
   or **one folder link** (a page listing every file with *Download all*
   as .zip). Both come back either way; you only choose what to show.
2. Without an account: `webly upload <file|folder>… [--folder name]`. It prints
   each file's link, the `folderUrl` and the `zipUrl`. A folder keeps its
   subfolders and hidden files (`src/main.cpp`, `.gitignore`); only `.DS_Store` is left out. Over 500 files it uploads them as one zip archive, served as a folder. Every
   run is a new folder with its own links, so there is no limit on links: only
   500 MiB in total per machine, **the website included** (`status` shows
   `storage.usedBytes` of `limitBytes`), 100 MiB per file. Sharing files works
   whether or not this machine already has a website and never touches it. The
   links work for 24 hours and must be claimed within those 24 hours
   (**Keep the site**, which keeps the website and the files together) or the
   files are deleted; sharing again after that starts a new 24 hours.
3. Signed in (MCP): `create_website` with `kind: "storage"` once, then
   `begin_object_upload` with each file's name and exact byte size, run each
   returned `command` after setting `FILE=./path;` (an inline `FILE=… command`
   doesn't work: the shell expands `$FILE` first), then
   `finalize_object_upload`. To keep a folder's structure, name each file by
   its path inside it (`src/main.cpp`) and include hidden files (`.gitignore`, `.idea/…`); never flatten a folder or drop its hidden files. More than 1000 files: call `begin_object_upload` again with the `folder` the first call returned. Free keeps files up to 7 days (1 GB, 100 MB per
   file); Base and Max can keep them forever (25 / 100 GB, 2 GB per file).
   Never put file bytes in a tool call.

Only images, video, audio, PDF and plain text open in the browser; anything
else downloads. Tell the person when the links stop working (`expiresAt`).

Managing shared files over MCP (the dashboard's Files page does the same):

- `list_objects` lists files with their `folder` and `folderLabel`.
- `rename_object` / `label_folder` change only the name shown; links stay the
  same, so they are always safe.
- `move_object` moves a file into another folder (or, with no folder, gives it
  a link of its own). **Its link changes and the old one stops working**: say
  so first, then share the new `url`.
- `delete_object` / `delete_folder` delete for good. Confirm first.
- **Passwords (Base and Max), only when the person asks.** `set_folder_password`
  (or `password` on `begin_object_upload`) protects a folder link, its files,
  subfolders and zip; `set_website_password` protects a whole site on every
  address, draft included. Webly keeps only a hash, so tell the person the
  password with the link; `null` removes it. On `402 plan_required`, give them
  `details.upgradeUrl`.
- `email_link` emails a folder link (or a site's published or draft link) to
  up to 10 people with an optional plain-text message (Base and Max). Webly
  builds the link; confirm the recipients with the person first. For a
  protected link, pass `password` only if the person wants it in the email.
- **Big folders (more than 500 files): upload one zip as an archive.** Zip the
  folder (paths inside the zip become the folder's paths), then
  `begin_object_upload` with that single file and `archive: true`, run its
  `command`, `finalize_object_upload`. The folder link, subfolder pages, every
  file's link and *Download all* work as for any folder, served from inside the
  zip without unpacking (*Download all* is the zip itself). `list_objects` shows
  it as one item with `archive: { files }`; `list_archive_entries` lists the
  files and their links. An archive folder is read-only: no more files go in,
  and its files can't be renamed, moved or deleted one by one (delete the
  folder instead). Zips must use stored or deflate entries, without encryption.
- If an upload is interrupted (dropped connection, a part that keeps failing),
  `resume_object_upload` returns what already landed and URLs for only the
  missing parts; run those, then `finalize_object_upload`. Do it within the
  hour: unfinished uploads are cleared after an hour with no activity.
- `list_uploads_in_progress` shows unfinished uploads and their progress;
  `clear_uploads_in_progress` cancels them to free the in-flight allowance
  (Free 1 GB, Base 5 GB, Max 10 GB). Ask first.
- Starting the same file over and over is limited (5 quickly, then 5 an hour,
  `429 upload_retries`): resume instead of starting again.
- `get_billing` shows `storage.used` (finished files, including site assets)
  and `storage.uploading` against their limits, like the dashboard's bar.

Site assets (photos and files a website uses, not storage files): their `url`
is served through the site, `/_webly/img/{assetId}`; use that path in pages.
`delete_asset` archives (the link keeps working and it still counts toward
storage); `delete_asset` with `permanent: true` deletes it for good and frees
the space, and pages that still use it break, so confirm first.

### What to tell the person

Put the URL on a line by itself, with nothing after it, so it stays clickable.
Then the deadlines, from the JSON, in their time zone if you know it:

> Your site is live:
>
> https://anon-….webly.site/
>
> It stays online for 24 hours (until {liveUntil}) and I can keep changing it
> until then. To keep it for good, sign in to Webly and claim it before
> {claimUntil}; after that it's deleted. Want me to set that up now?

Offer the claim once per site, not after every edit. Never show the token or
the contents of `~/.webly/`.

### Errors (`details.reason`)

| Reason | Means | Do |
|---|---|---|
| `site_already_created` | This token already has a site | `webly deploy` updates it; use `replace` only for a new URL |
| `edit_window_closed` (410) | 24 hours are up; offline but claimable | **Keep the site** |
| `build_failed` (400) | A swap's new site didn't build; the old one is untouched | Fix the files, retry |
| `network_limit` (409) | 50 live anonymous sites on this network | Wait `details.retryAfterSeconds`, or sign in |
| `credential_consumed` / `credential_expired` | Token is dead (claimed, or past 7 days) | The helper already deleted it; the next deploy starts fresh |
| `invite_only` (503) | Anonymous publishing is switched off | Sign in instead |
| HTTP 429 | Rate limited | Wait for `Retry-After` |
| `anonymous_storage_limit` (413) | The 500 MiB (website and files together) is used up | Claim (**Keep the site**) to get a free account's 1 GB |
| HTTP 413 | Over a size limit | Trim files, or sign in |

## Keep the site: sign in and claim

Run this when the person wants to keep the site, make an account or sign in, or
when `next.actions` is only `["claim"]`. Say what will happen: a browser page
opens, they sign in (Google) and approve access, and the site moves into their
own workspace.

1. **Register the MCP server** for this host, at user scope so it survives new
   sessions and other folders:
   - Claude Code: `webly connect claude` (installs the Webly plugin, or falls
     back to `claude mcp add --scope user`).
   - Codex: `webly connect codex`.
   - Other hosts: follow https://webly.ai/agent.md, Phase 2.
   `connect` also records `pending: claim`, so the claim is finished by
   whichever session loads the tools first. Its `next` field says what to do.
2. **Use MCP if it's already callable; otherwise claim in the browser now.**
   Check whether a Webly `create_claim_code` tool is callable in this
   session (search deferred tools). If yes, go to step 4. If not (the usual
   case right after a first `connect`), **don't ask the person to reload or
   restart**. Run `webly claim-link --open` straight away. It opens
   `app.webly.ai/claim` with the token in the URL fragment (never sent to a
   server, never printed). Ask them to sign in and click **Claim website**. If the
   page shows the wrong Google account, **Not you? Use a different account**
   switches it.
   Opening the page or signing in alone does not claim the site. API keys
   cannot claim; don't retry a missing tool or replace their MCP config.
3. **Confirm the browser claim.** After they say they're done, run
   `webly doctor`: only `siteError.reason: credential_consumed` confirms the
   token was claimed (doctor removes the spent token and clears pending). If
   it is still unclaimed, the browser was closed, or status is unavailable,
   keep the token and pending step so they can retry. Never run `forget`
   merely because the browser opened. MCP loads by itself next session
   (Codex: `codex mcp login webly` first). Stop here; steps 4-5 are the MCP
   path.
4. **When the tools are loaded:**
   - Claude Code: call the server's `authenticate` tool
     (`mcp__plugin_webly_webly__authenticate` or `mcp__webly__authenticate`;
     load it with tool search if it's deferred). It returns an authorization
     URL. Open it for them (`open "<url>"` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux,
     `start` on Windows) and print it as a fallback. The callback completes by
     itself.
   - Other hosts: call `whoami`; the 401 starts the host's own sign-in.
   - The consent page offers `webly:content`, `webly:edit` and `webly:admin`
     and defaults to `webly:admin`, which creating sites needs. Tell them to
     keep it unless they only want you editing existing sites (`webly:edit`).
5. **Claim:** call `create_claim_code`, then run `webly claim <code>`. The
   helper sends the code and the saved token to Webly itself, so you never
   read the token, and on success it deletes the token and the pending step.
   Tell them which site moved and give the printed `dashboardUrl`. A retry by
   the same person is safe (`alreadyClaimed: true`). The code lasts 10
   minutes; get a new one if it expired (`claim_code_invalid`).

After the claim: with billing off, or on a paid plan with a free slot, the site
is permanent. On the Free plan with billing on it's *held*: editable until the
original 24-hour mark, then offline until they upgrade (`402 claim_held`). Say
which one the response shows (`website.claimHeld`); don't promise permanence.

## Working over MCP (signed in)

Call `whoami` and `list_websites` first, and continue an existing site (the
folder's linked one, if `doctor` shows a link) rather than creating a second
one. After `create_website` for a project on disk, run `webly link
<websiteId>` in the project folder so later sessions find it.

1. Framework sites (typed React, the default): `acquire_edit_lease`, then
   `put_source_file` / `str_replace`. Static sites: `deploy_files` only for a
   few small text edits. For a folder on disk (a build's `dist/`, anything with
   bundles or images), call `begin_deploy` with the site's id and straight away
   run `webly deploy <folder> --ticket <ticket>` (the ticket lasts 5 minutes and
   one deploy; never echo it back to the person). The helper builds the project
   if needed, uploads it (up to 2000 files, 1 MiB each, 100 MiB in all), links
   the folder and prints the draft URL. Never put a bundle's bytes in a tool
   call or an API key in a shell command. If it stops with **`would_revert`**,
   the deploy would undo changes made to the site since this folder last
   deployed it (the paths are listed): read them with `read_source_files`,
   merge them into the local project, rebuild, and deploy again with a new
   ticket; or tell the person what would be undone and, only with their OK,
   deploy with a new ticket and `--force`. If the result has `replaced`, tell
   the person the site had changed elsewhere and earlier versions are kept. Each write
   makes a new draft version; the live site doesn't change. Writes are
   Prettier-formatted, so copy `str_replace` text from `read_source_file`.
2. `check_head` runs the quality gate (lint, typecheck, bundle, render). Fix
   every diagnostic.
3. Show the person the draft URL (`https://draft--{subdomain}.webly.site`, not
   public, not indexed).
4. `publish_website` only after they say yes to that exact site and version.
   `rollback_website` / `unpublish_website` if something is wrong live.

New sites get a short generated address (`zen-wreath-y76r.webly.site`); don't pass
`subdomain` unless the person asks for a specific one (up to 56 characters; a taken
one is a `409`, not a variant). On Base and Max the workspace also has a namespace
and each published site answers at `urls.vanity`
(`https://fall-out-boy.kev.webly.site`, the label from the site's name, unique only
within the namespace). Share `urls.primary`: the main address (a custom domain
when one is live, else the vanity, else the flat address); `urls.all` lists every
address the site answers at. `rename_vanity`
changes a site's label; `get_namespace` / `check_namespace` / `rename_namespace`
handle the namespace. Renames are scarce (Base 1, Max 5, lifetime), so rename
only to the exact name the person asked for, and tell them old vanity addresses
stop working. On `402`, give them `details.upgradeUrl`.

New content, including blog posts and repeating content (products, team, FAQs),
goes in the site's source files; don't create collections or blog posts, the CMS
is deprecated. A site that already reads collections or a managed blog keeps
using those tools for that content until the owner asks to move it. Forms
post with `formAction('name')`, never `mailto:`.
Details are in llms.txt.

`403` names the missing capability in `details.capability`: the grant was
narrower than the task, so tell them which access level covers it. `401` /
`invalid_token`: call a Webly tool again to re-trigger sign-in; don't start a
second attempt while one is waiting. `409 Invalid edit lease`: re-acquire and
re-read before writing.

### Custom domains

Needs a signed-in account (MCP). "Connect example.com to my site":

1. Pick the site with `list_websites`. Never guess it from the hostname.
2. For a bare domain, ask first:
   - **`www.example.com` (recommended).** It works with every DNS provider.
     The person then forwards `example.com` to it at their registrar, which is
     free and takes a minute.
   - **`example.com` directly.** Only if their DNS provider supports CNAME
     flattening or ALIAS at the root (Cloudflare, Namecheap, Porkbun…).
   For a subdomain such as `shop.example.com`, just add it.
3. Call `add_domain`. Give the person the required `dns.records` **exactly as
   returned**, as a Type / Name / Value table. For a www domain, also give the
   `apexForward` forwarding rule. Provider tips:
   - Type only the Name shown (`www`, or `@` for the root). GoDaddy and
     Namecheap add the domain themselves.
   - On Cloudflare, set the record to "DNS only" (grey cloud).
   - Moving a domain that is live elsewhere? Keep its current record and add
     only the optional TXT records. Then:
     1. Poll `verify_domain` until the domain is `active`. That means ownership
        is verified and the certificate is deployed. Step 2 isn't enough.
        `domain-watch` can't show this yet, because the old host still answers.
     2. Ask the person to switch the CNAME.
     3. Run `webly domain-watch <hostname>` to confirm traffic now reaches
        Webly.
4. Start watching in the background right away. Don't wait for the person to
   say they're done:
   `webly domain-watch <hostname>` as a background task. It prints `dns`,
   `https` and `live` as each happens and exits once the domain is live.
   Without a shell, call `verify_domain` every `next.checkAgainSeconds`.
   Every domain response has `next` with the step (1 DNS record, 2 HTTPS
   certificate, 3 live) and what to do. Tell the person when each step
   completes.
5. Once live: confirm `https://<hostname>` loads, then offer
   `set_primary_domain` so every other address redirects to it. If it's
   `failed`, relay `failureMessage`, have them fix the record, then call
   `verify_domain` again.

Adding a domain publishes nothing and takes nothing offline. The
`*.webly.site` address keeps working.

## Rules

- The token is a secret that proves ownership. Never print it, log it, commit
  it, or put it in a URL other than through `webly claim-link`.
- Only state URLs, sites and counts that a command or tool actually returned.
- Don't set up MCP for someone who only wants a quick link; offer it when they
  want to keep or grow the site.
- One anonymous site per machine. If they want a second site kept, claim the
  first, then create the second over MCP and `webly link` it.
- A folder belongs to the site in its `.webly/project.json`. Never deploy it
